Building a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid


Defining the research question


Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid

Defining the Metric for Success


This project will be considered a success when are able to develop a prediction model that has a high level of accuracy, does not suffer from instances of overfitting or underfitting and has a good bias-variance tradeoff balance

Understanding the context


Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients and the hospital want to develop an algorithm that can predict if the patient has hypothoid. This research aims to use robust machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model that can identify whether or not a patient has a hypothyroid condition based on their symptoms. The model will be trained on thyroid patients' data that was collected by Nairobi Hospital.

Exprimental Design


Below are the steps followed in this analysis to ensure that the research question is addresed comprehensively:

Data sourcing and understanding

Data cleaning

Exploratory Analysis

Implementing the Solution (DecisionTrees and SVM)
